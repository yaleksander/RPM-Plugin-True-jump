Assign the Maneuver function to the hero's default move options to allow horizontal control of the jump while airborne. These commands are meant for the hero but they can also be used for any map event.\n\nWARNING! Due to how in-game collisions are coded, this plugin is still somewhat experimental. It may cause some bugs and make the characters clip through some objects, so build your maps carefully.","name":"True jump","parameters":[{"defaultValue":{"k":12,"v":5},"description":"Gravity acceleration in squares per second²","id":-1,"name":"Gravity"}],"type":1,"version":"1.2.0","website":"https://github.com/yaleksander/RPM-Plugin-True-jump"}
